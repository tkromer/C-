/*
 * Functions used for the AI to choose its targets. The noteworthy function is
 * enemyTurn(), which should be called when it is the computer's turn.
 * by Sean T. Hayes
 *
 * Version 1.11 (Included missing string header)
 * Version 1.10 (Removed stack and accounted for hits in the prob dist.)
 *
 * If SIMULATION is defined, hit and miss information is not displayed.
 *
 * Some of this AI was inspired from the DataGenetics post found here:
 * https://datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/
 *
 * Instead of using a stack, a probability bonus the areas near a known hit.
 * Concern: Can we know for sure if a previous hit was on a ship
 *          that is now sunk? Right now, that is assumed (slight cheat?).
